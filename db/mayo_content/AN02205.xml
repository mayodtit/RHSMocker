Guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services say that children and adolescents age 6 and older need at least an hour a day of physical activity. Most of the hour should be either moderate or vigorous aerobic activity. In addition, children should participate in muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least three days a week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many classic activities &amp;mdash; such as playing on playground equipment and jumping rope &amp;mdash; cover all the bases at once. Organized sports are a great way to stay fit too. But team sports or dance classes aren&apos;t the only options. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get creative as you search for activities your child enjoys. If your child is artistically inclined, take a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks for use in a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest jungle gym. If your child likes to read, walk or bike to a local library for a book. Or simply turn on your child&apos;s favorite music and dance in the living room. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Exercise with your child to better your own health while helping modeling for and stimulating your child to develop good exercise habits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Remember, incorporating physical activity into your child&apos;s daily routine sets the foundation for a lifetime of fitness and good health.
