Dental braces are the familiar wire-based appliances that orthodontists use to correct crowded and misaligned teeth or jaws. Many people who need dental braces get them during their early adolescent years. But adults can get dental braces, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The goal of dental braces is to properly align your teeth and jaws and produce an even bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Modern materials and technologies make the experience of having dental braces much more comfortable and enjoyable than in the past.
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

			<SectionHead>
				Why it&apos;s done
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Dental braces offer corrective treatment for:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Overcrowded or crooked teeth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prominent upper front teeth (overbite)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Upper front teeth that bite behind the lower ones (underbite)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Other jaw misalignment problems that cause an uneven bite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proper alignment of your teeth and jaws may improve not only the appearance of your teeth, but the way you bite, chew and speak. Teeth that fit neatly together are also easier to clean and maintain, which means they&apos;re less prone to plaque formation, cavities and gum disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Adults and braces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Adults may think that braces aren&apos;t for them, but braces can help solve some of the same problems in adults that they do in children, including crooked teeth and misaligned jaws. If you&apos;re an adult with braces, you may need to wear them a while longer than a younger person might, but they can still produce similar results. Because your facial bones are no longer growing, however, there may be some problems that can&apos;t be corrected with braces alone.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Risks
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Wearing dental braces is generally a very safe procedure, but there are certain risks present, both in the short term and long term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Short-term risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Braces create tiny spaces around your teeth that can trap food particles and provide a convenient deposit site for bacteria-laden plaque. Failure to remove deposits of food and plaque can lead to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Demineralization of your teeth&apos;s outer enamel surface, which can leave permanent whitish stains on your teeth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cavities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To avoid damage&lt;/strong&gt; to your teeth and braces: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut down on sugary and starchy foods,&lt;/strong&gt; which inordinately contribute to plaque formation and tooth decay.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brush carefully,&lt;/strong&gt; preferably after every meal, with fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush. If you can&apos;t brush your teeth after your meal, rinse your mouth out with water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a fluoride rinse&lt;/strong&gt; if recommended by your dentist or orthodontist.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floss&lt;/strong&gt; between braces and under wires with the help of a floss threader.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have your teeth cleaned&lt;/strong&gt; professionally as often as your dentist recommends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid sticky foods&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; such as chewing gum, chewy candies, caramel and taffy &amp;mdash; that can pull off brackets and bands.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid hard foods&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; such as ice, hard candies, popcorn and nuts &amp;mdash; that can break various parts of your braces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Long-term risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Long-term risks may include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shorter root lengths.&lt;/strong&gt; During tooth movement, some of the bone in the path of the moving tooth dissolves, while new bone is laid behind it. Permanent loss of tooth root length may occur during this process, which could lead to less stable teeth. In most cases, however, this doesn&apos;t cause any problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of correction.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&apos;t follow your orthodontist&apos;s instructions carefully after your braces are removed, particularly when it comes to wearing a device called a retainer, you may lose some of the correction gained while wearing your braces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				How you prepare
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
If your primary care dentist notices problems with your teeth or jaws that may require treatment, he or she will likely refer you to an orthodontist &amp;mdash; a dentist who specializes in diagnosing, preventing and treating dental and facial irregularities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most alignment problems become apparent once the permanent teeth begin to erupt. But your orthodontist may recommend waiting until enough teeth have come through before applying braces. Most children get braces between the ages of 8 and 14, while their facial bones are still growing and their teeth are more susceptible to movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Preparation for braces generally involves:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical examination.&lt;/strong&gt; Your orthodontist conducts a full examination of your teeth, jaws and mouth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X-rays.&lt;/strong&gt; Your orthodontist, your dentist, or a dental assistant takes a series of X-rays to determine the position of teeth. The most common is the panoramic X-ray, which shows all the upper and lower teeth in biting position, and any teeth still developing within the jaws. Special head X-rays may also help determine the size, position and relationship of jaws to teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plaster models.&lt;/strong&gt; Your orthodontist typically obtains plaster models of your teeth to evaluate your bite. To do this, your orthodontist or hygienist makes an impression of your teeth using a soft material. This process takes only a few minutes to complete. From this impression, the orthodontist can create a plaster model of your teeth (dental cast). In some cases, this dental cast may be scanned into a digital format for further evaluation or treatment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential tooth extraction.&lt;/strong&gt; If the mouth is very overcrowded, your orthodontist may recommend removing one or more permanent teeth to allow room for the remaining teeth to fit comfortably. In severe cases, jaw surgery is required in combination with orthodontics to correct a malaligned bite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After your orthodontist has evaluated your teeth and jaws, he or she customizes a treatment plan for you. This most often involves the use of fixed braces, which are temporarily bonded to your teeth and can&apos;t be taken out.
&lt;/p&gt;

				What you can expect
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Treatment consists essentially of three phases: the initial placement of the braces (or clear aligners), periodic adjustments and wearing of a retainer after the braces are removed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Placement of braces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your visit to have the braces applied typically lasts about 45 minutes. Fixed braces typically consist of the following components: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brackets&lt;/strong&gt; attached to the outside surfaces of the premolar and front teeth (sometimes they can be attached to the backside of teeth, hiding them from view, but this makes them slightly more difficult to access). Brackets can be made of stainless steel, titanium, polycarbonate, ceramic, or a combination of a polycarbonate base and ceramic bracket. Modern metal brackets are smaller and less noticeable than they used to be. Ceramic brackets are usually clear or tooth-colored, and are less obvious than metal brackets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring-like bands&lt;/strong&gt; that encircle the molar teeth. Bands are made of stainless steel or titanium. A buccal tube attached to the band of the last molar holds the end of the connecting archwire in place.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A flexible wire (archwire)&lt;/strong&gt; that connects all of the brackets and bands, controlling movement of the teeth. Today&apos;s wires may be made of nickel and titanium, which are superelastic and have shape memory, making them more flexible than stainless steel. While they are more expensive, they tend to require fewer adjustments.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various accessories&lt;/strong&gt; may help position the teeth, in addition to the fixed components. Small rubber bands (elastic ties) secure the archwire to the brackets. Headgear (usually worn at night) may be used to help hold or move teeth in the correct position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Removable clear aligners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For adults who need minor corrections, an alternate option to fixed braces is a series of clear, customized, removable appliances called aligners. You may have heard these referred to as &quot;invisible braces.&quot; Each set of aligners is worn for a period of two weeks, 22 to 23 hours a day, until it&apos;s replaced by the next set. Aligners can be removed for eating, drinking, brushing and flossing. Clear aligners may be more expensive than fixed braces but may also be more aesthetically acceptable to some adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Periodic adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After braces are placed on your teeth, your orthodontist adjusts them every four to six weeks by tightening the interconnecting wires. This puts mild pressure on the teeth and gradually shifts them into new positions. The jaw responds to the pressure by dissolving bone in the path of the moving tooth and laying down new bone behind it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Occasionally, the orthodontist may use tension between upper and lower jaws to help promote correct alignment. This is often done with elastic bands stretched between opposing teeth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your teeth and jaws may feel slightly sore for a day or two after an adjustment. This discomfort can usually be eased with an over-the-counter pain reliever; tell your orthodontist if the discomfort is severe or becomes worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Retainers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After dental braces are removed, the newly straightened teeth need to be stabilized for a period of time (retention period) to prevent them from shifting back to their original position. This is usually accomplished with the use of a retainer, a custom-made appliance typically made of plastic and metal wires that help teeth stay in place. These are usually removable, but may be fixed in some cases. 
&lt;/p&gt;

On average, most people wear full braces for one to three years. Retainers may be worn for months, years or indefinitely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Braces are generally very effective in realigning crooked teeth and correcting improperly positioned jaws. But the person wearing the braces has an important role to play in the ultimate success of the treatment. Care must be taken to follow your orthodontist&apos;s instructions precisely, especially during the retention period. When it comes to this final phase, it&apos;s important to wear the retainer as directed, or risk losing the benefits gained while wearing the fixed braces.
