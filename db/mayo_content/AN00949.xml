Recurrent strep throat isn&apos;t likely a sign of an underlying problem with a child&apos;s immune system. Children who develop strep throat repeatedly may have contact with a carrier of strep, likely at home or in a child care setting &amp;mdash; or may be strep carriers themselves. A strep carrier is someone who still has the strep-causing bacteria, but who has been treated and no longer has symptoms. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Strep throat is an infection caused by a bacterium known as group A streptococcus. Strep throat can occur at any age, even during infancy. However, strep throat is most common in school-age children and young adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the few infants who develop strep throat, signs and symptoms may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sleeplessness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Irritability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Refusal to breast-feed or drink from a bottle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Occasionally, a fine, red rash on the torso, arms and legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Strep throat is diagnosed with a throat culture, in which the doctor swabs the child&apos;s throat and tests the sample for the presence of strep bacteria. Treatment for strep throat is typically a course of antibiotics. Recurrent strep throat is often treated with a different antibiotic from the one prescribed originally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
