A sacral dimple is an indentation, present at birth, in the skin on the lower back. It&apos;s usually located just above the crease between the buttocks. Most sacral dimples are harmless and don&apos;t require any treatment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sacral dimples that are accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or certain types of skin discoloration are sometimes associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. In these instances, your child&apos;s doctor may recommend an imaging test. If an abnormality is discovered, treatment depends on the underlying cause.

A sacral dimple consists of an indentation, or &quot;pit,&quot; in the skin on the lower back, just above the crease between the buttocks.

				&lt;p&gt;
A sacral dimple is a congenital condition, meaning it&apos;s present at birth. There are no known causes.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Complications

				&lt;p&gt;
Rarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spina bifida.&lt;/strong&gt; A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn&apos;t close properly around the spinal cord but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tethered cord syndrome.&lt;/strong&gt; The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or certain types of skin discoloration.

In general, your child won&apos;t need to see a doctor for a sacral dimple. If you have questions about the sacral dimple, you can also bring these up at your child&apos;s routine office visits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some questions you might want to ask your child&apos;s doctor include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does my child need any tests to be sure there&apos;s no other cause?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does the area need any special cleaning or care?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is any treatment necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is a sacral dimple ever associated with more serious conditions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				Tests and diagnosis
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Sacral dimples are present at birth and are evident during an infant&apos;s initial physical exam. In most cases, further testing is unnecessary. However, if the dimple is very large or is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or certain types of skin discoloration, your doctor may suggest imaging tests to rule out spinal cord problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These tests may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound.&lt;/strong&gt; This noninvasive procedure uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures of the body.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/strong&gt; If more detail is needed, your doctor may recommend an MRI, which uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create cross-sectional images of the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
