				&lt;p&gt;
Nervous stomach is an old-fashioned term for chronic indigestion. The idea of having a nervous organ could be a holdover from about 100 years ago, when a syndrome called nervous exhaustion or neurasthenia &amp;mdash; thought to be caused by &quot;nerve irritation&quot; &amp;mdash; was a fairly common diagnosis. The typical treatment was a long period of rest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today, it would be unusual for a doctor to say you have a nervous stomach. That said, your nervous system can definitely affect your digestion. In fact, some functions of your nervous and digestive systems are so interdependent that they&apos;re thought of as a unit &amp;mdash; the brain-gut axis. Your digestive tract also has its own separate nervous system, known as the enteric nervous system, which operates independently of your brain to regulate certain aspects of digestion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The brain-gut axis could be involved in the chronic digestive problems known as functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain. These conditions aren&apos;t the result of a structural abnormality or infection in your gastrointestinal tract, but they can take a serious toll on your quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a recurrent digestive problem, tell your doctor what it is &amp;mdash; stomach pain, heartburn, bloating, diarrhea or several symptoms at different times. You&apos;ll also need a physical examination, possibly followed by tests to diagnose or rule out an ulcer, gallstones or any other specific disease your symptoms suggest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This workup may not identify a specific abnormality. If you&apos;re otherwise healthy, though, further testing is usually unnecessary. Instead, your doctor may suggest that you keep a symptom record and track your diet, mealtimes, stress levels and other variables that may be triggering your problems. This record may highlight a few simple changes you can make to reduce the frequency of your symptoms. A combination of lifestyle adjustment, medication and behavioral treatment usually brings functional gastrointestinal disorders under control.
