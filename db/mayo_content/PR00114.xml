The end of your pregnancy is near! By now, you might be tired of being pregnant &amp;mdash; and eager to meet your baby face to face. Your uterus, however, is still a busy place. Understand how fetal development continues as you approach your due date. Here&apos;s a weekly calendar of events for the third trimester. Keep in mind that measurements are approximate.

				Week 28: Baby&apos;s eyes open
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Twenty-eight weeks into your pregnancy, or 26 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s eyelids are partially open and eyelashes have formed. Your baby is gaining weight, which is smoothing out many of the wrinkles in his or her skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might be nearly 10 inches (250 millimeters) long from crown to rump and weigh nearly 2 1/4 pounds (1,000 grams). Otherwise healthy babies born this week have a 90 percent chance of survival without physical or neurological impairment &amp;mdash; and the odds improve with each passing week.

				Week 29: Baby&apos;s bones are fully developed

				&lt;p&gt;
Twenty-nine weeks into your pregnancy, or 27 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s bones are fully developed, but they&apos;re still soft and pliable.

				Week 30: Baby&apos;s eyes are wide open
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty weeks into your pregnancy, or 28 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s eyes are wide open a good part of the time. Your baby might have a good head of hair by this week. Red blood cells are now forming in your baby&apos;s bone marrow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might be more than 10 1/2 inches (270 millimeters) long from crown to rump and weigh nearly 3 pounds (1,300 grams).

				Week 31: Sexual development continues
			</SectionHead>

Thirty-one weeks into your pregnancy, or 29 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s central nervous system has matured to the stage where it can control body temperature.

				Week 32: Baby practices breathing
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-two weeks into your pregnancy, or 30 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s toenails are visible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although your baby&apos;s lungs aren&apos;t fully formed, he or she practices breathing. Your baby&apos;s body begins absorbing vital minerals, such as iron and calcium from the intestinal tract. The layer of soft, downy hair that has covered your baby&apos;s skin for the past few months &amp;mdash; known as lanugo &amp;mdash; starts to fall off this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might be 11 inches (280 millimeters) long from crown to rump and weigh 3 3/4 pounds (1,700 grams).

				Week 33: Baby detects light

				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-three weeks into your pregnancy, or 31 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s pupils can constrict, dilate and detect light entering his or her eyes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Week 34: Baby&apos;s fingernails grow
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-four weeks into your pregnancy, or 32 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s fingernails have reached his or her fingertips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might be nearly 12 inches (300 millimeters) long from crown to rump. The pasty white coating that protects your baby&apos;s skin &amp;mdash; the vernix caseosa &amp;mdash; is about to get thicker.
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

				Week 35: Protective coating thickens
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-five weeks into your pregnancy, or 33 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s limbs are becoming chubby. Your baby is gaining weight rapidly &amp;mdash; about 1/2 pound (230 grams) a week for the next month. 
&lt;/p&gt;

			<SectionHead>
				Week 36: Rapid weight gain begins
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-six weeks into your pregnancy, or 34 weeks after conception, the crowded conditions inside your uterus might make it harder for your baby to give you a punch. However, you&apos;ll probably still feel lots of stretches, rolls and wiggles. You might want to check on your baby&apos;s movements from time to time (kick count) &amp;mdash; especially if you think you&apos;ve noticed decreased activity. Ask your health care provider how many movements you should detect in a certain number of hours.

				Week 37: Baby is full term
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-seven weeks into your pregnancy, or 35 weeks after conception, your baby will be considered full term. Your baby&apos;s organs are ready to function on their own. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To prepare for birth, your baby&apos;s head might start descending into your pelvis. If your baby isn&apos;t head down, your health care provider will talk to you about ways to deal with this issue.

				Week 38: Baby develops a firm grasp
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-eight weeks into your pregnancy, or 36 weeks after conception, your baby is developing a firm grasp. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your baby&apos;s toenails have reached the tips of his or her toes. His or her brain might weigh about 14 ounces (400 grams). After birth, your baby&apos;s brain will continue to grow. Your baby has mostly shed all of his or her lanugo. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might weigh about 6 1/2 pounds (2,900 grams).

				Week 39: Placenta provides antibodies
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-nine weeks into your pregnancy, or 37 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s chest is becoming more prominent. For boys, the testes continue to descend into the scrotum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The placenta continues to supply your baby with antibodies that will help fight infection after birth. If you breast-feed your baby, your milk will provide additional antibodies.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Week 40: Your due date arrives
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Forty weeks into your pregnancy, or 38 weeks after conception, your baby might be about 18 to 20 inches (450 to 500 millimeters) long and weigh 6 1/2 pounds (2,900 grams) or more. Remember, however, that healthy babies come in different sizes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&apos;t be alarmed if your due date comes and goes without incident. It&apos;s just as normal to deliver a baby a week or two late &amp;mdash; or early &amp;mdash; as it is to deliver on your due date.
