				&lt;p&gt;
Can&apos;t find your car keys? Forget what&apos;s on your grocery list? Can&apos;t remember the name of the personal trainer you liked at the gym? You&apos;re not alone. Everyone forgets things occasionally. Still, memory loss is nothing to take lightly. Although there are no guarantees when it comes to preventing memory loss or dementia, memory tricks can be helpful. Consider seven simple ways to sharpen your memory &amp;mdash; and know when to seek help for memory loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				No. 1: Stay mentally active
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Just as physical activity helps keep your body in shape, mentally stimulating activities help keep your brain in shape &amp;mdash; and perhaps keep memory loss at bay. Do crossword puzzles. Read a section of the newspaper that you normally skip. Take alternate routes when driving. Learn to play a musical instrument. Volunteer at a local school or community organization. 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

				No. 2: Socialize regularly
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Social interaction helps ward off depression and stress, both of which can contribute to memory loss. Look for opportunities to get together with loved ones, friends and others &amp;mdash; especially if you live alone. When you&apos;re invited to share a meal or attend an event, go! 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

			<SectionHead>
				No. 3: Get organized
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
You&apos;re more likely to forget things if your home is cluttered and your notes are in disarray. Jot down tasks, appointments and other events in a special notebook, calendar or electronic planner. You might even repeat each entry out loud as you jot it down to help cement it in your memory. Keep to-do lists current, and check off items you&apos;ve completed. Set aside a certain place for your wallet, keys and other essentials. 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>
		</Section>
		<Section>
			<SectionHead>
				No. 4: Focus
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Limit distractions, and don&apos;t try to do too many things at once. If you focus on the information that you&apos;re trying to remember, you&apos;ll be more likely to recall it later. It might also help to connect what you&apos;re trying to remember to a favorite song or another familiar concept. 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>
		</Section>
		<Section>
			<SectionHead>
				No. 5: Eat a healthy diet
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
A heart-healthy diet may be as good for your brain as it is for your heart. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Choose low-fat protein sources, such as fish, lean meat and skinless poultry. What you drink counts, too. Not enough water or too much alcohol can lead to confusion and memory loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

				No. 6: Include physical activity in your daily routine
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Physical activity increases blood flow to your whole body, including your brain. This may help keep your memory sharp. For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (think brisk walking) or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity (such as jogging) &amp;mdash; preferably spread throughout the week. If you don&apos;t have time for a full workout, squeeze in a few 10-minute walks throughout the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
			</HTML>

				No. 7: Manage chronic conditions
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Follow your doctor&apos;s treatment recommendations for any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and depression. The better you take care of yourself, the better your memory is likely to be. In addition, review your medications with your doctor regularly. Various medications can impact memory.

				&lt;p&gt;
If you&apos;re worried about memory loss &amp;mdash; especially if memory loss affects your ability to complete your usual daily activities &amp;mdash; consult your doctor. He or she will likely do a physical exam, as well as check your memory and problem-solving skills. Sometimes other tests are needed as well. Treatment will depend on what&apos;s contributing to the memory loss.
