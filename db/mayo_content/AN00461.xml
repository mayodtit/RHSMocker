				&lt;p&gt;
A tilted uterus, also called a tipped uterus or retroverted uterus, is a normal anatomical variation. It shouldn&apos;t interfere with your ability to conceive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In most women, the uterus tips forward at the cervix. About one in four women, however, have a uterus that leans backward, or tilts, at the cervix. In the past, it was thought that a tilted uterus may contribute to infertility. But experts now know that the position of the uterus doesn&apos;t affect the ability of sperm to reach an egg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rarely, a sharply tilted uterus may be due to a disease such as endometriosis. In this case, endometriosis &amp;mdash; not the position of the uterus &amp;mdash; may be a cause of infertility.
&lt;/p&gt;
