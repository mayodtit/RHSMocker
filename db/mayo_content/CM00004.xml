Your mobile phone is ringing, your boss wants to talk to you and your partner wants to know what&apos;s for dinner. Stress and anxiety are everywhere. If they&apos;re getting the best of you, you might want to hit the mat and give yoga a try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yoga is a mind-body practice that combines stretching exercises, controlled breathing and relaxation. Yoga can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure and improve heart function. And almost anyone can do it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Yoga is considered a mind-body type of complementary and alternative medicine practice. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve peacefulness of body and mind, helping you relax and manage stress and anxiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yoga has many styles, forms and intensities. Hatha yoga, in particular, may be a good choice for stress management. Hatha is one of the most common styles of yoga, and beginners may like its slower pace and easier movements. But most people can benefit from any style of yoga &amp;mdash; it&apos;s all about your personal preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The core components of hatha yoga and most general yoga classes are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poses.&lt;/strong&gt; Yoga poses, also called postures, are a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility. Poses range from lying on the floor while completely relaxed to difficult postures that may have you stretching your physical limits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Controlling your breathing is an important part of yoga. In yoga, breath signifies your vital energy. Yoga teaches that controlling your breathing can help you control your body and quiet your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The potential health benefits of yoga include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress reduction.&lt;/strong&gt; A number of studies have shown that yoga can help reduce stress and anxiety. It can also enhance your mood and overall sense of well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved fitness.&lt;/strong&gt; Practicing yoga can lead to improved balance, flexibility, range of motion and strength. And this means you&apos;re less likely to injure yourself in other physical endeavors or in your daily activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of chronic conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; Yoga can help reduce risk factors for chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure. Yoga might also help alleviate chronic conditions, such as depression, pain, anxiety and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;

				Yoga precautions

				&lt;p&gt;
Yoga is generally considered safe for most healthy people when practiced under the guidance of a trained instructor. But there are some situations in which yoga might pose a risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See your health care provider before you begin yoga if you have any of the following conditions or situations: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A herniated disk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A risk of blood clots&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Deconditioned state&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eye conditions, including glaucoma&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hyperthyroidism&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Severe balance problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Severe osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Uncontrolled blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You may be able to practice yoga in these situations if you take certain precautions, such as avoiding certain poses or stretches. If you develop symptoms or concerns, see your doctor to make sure you&apos;re getting benefit and not harm from yoga.

				Getting started
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Although you can learn yoga from books and videos, beginners usually find it helpful to learn with an instructor. Classes also offer camaraderie and friendship, which are also important to overall well-being. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you find a class that sounds interesting, talk with the instructor so that you know what to expect. Questions to ask include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are the instructor&apos;s qualifications? Where did he or she train and how long has he or she been teaching?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does the instructor have experience working with students with your needs or health concerns? If you have a sore knee or an aching shoulder, can the instructor help you find poses that won&apos;t aggravate your condition?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How demanding is the class? Is it suitable for beginners? Will it be easy enough to follow along if it&apos;s your first time?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What can you expect from the class? Is it aimed at your needs, such as stress management or relaxation, or is it geared for people who want to reap other benefits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				Achieving the right balance

				&lt;p&gt;
Everyone&apos;s body is different, and yoga postures should be modified based on individual abilities. Selecting an instructor who is experienced and attentive to your needs is an important first step to a safe and effective yoga practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of which type of yoga you practice, you don&apos;t have to do every pose. If a pose is uncomfortable or you can&apos;t hold it as long as the instructor requests, don&apos;t do it. Good instructors will understand and encourage you to explore &amp;mdash; but not exceed &amp;mdash; your personal limits.
