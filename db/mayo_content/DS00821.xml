				&lt;p&gt;
In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the fetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ &amp;mdash; the uterus. Sometimes, however, the tubes don&apos;t join completely. Instead, each one develops into a separate structure. This condition is called double uterus (uterus didelphys). A double uterus may have one opening (cervix) into one vagina, or each uterine cavity may have a cervix. There may even be two vaginas. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Double uterus is rare &amp;mdash; and sometimes never diagnosed. The percentage of women with a double uterus is likely higher in those with a history of miscarriage or premature birth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Treatment is needed only if a double uterus causes symptoms or complications, such as pelvic pain, repeated miscarriages or preterm labor.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Symptoms
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Some women have a double uterus and never realize it &amp;mdash; even during pregnancy and childbirth. Each cavity in a double uterus often leads to its own cervix. Some women with a double uterus also have a duplicate or divided vagina. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Possible signs and symptoms may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unusual pressure or cramping pain before or during a menstrual period &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abnormal bleeding during a period, such as blood flow despite the use of a tampon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;If you have signs and symptoms of a double uterus, make an appointment with your doctor. An early diagnosis is especially important if you plan to become pregnant or if you&apos;ve had repeated miscarriages. Your doctor can recommend treatment options to improve your chances of getting pregnant, staying pregnant and having a safe delivery. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&apos;ve been diagnosed with a double uterus and are considering pregnancy, talk with your doctor first. Together you can make a plan for optimal care during pregnancy and delivery. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Causes

				&lt;p&gt;
Researchers don&apos;t know what causes a double uterus. This condition may be associated with kidney abnormalities, which suggests that something may influence the development of these related structures before birth.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Complications

			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Many women with a double uterus have normal sex lives, pregnancies and deliveries. But sometimes a double uterus and other abnormalities of uterine development lead to infertility or miscarriage. A double uterus may also cause premature birth or unusual positions of the baby in the uterus, such as bottom down (breech presentation).

				Preparing for your appointment
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
You&apos;re likely to start by seeing your primary care provider. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the female reproductive tract (gynecologist) or a doctor who specializes in reproductive hormones and optimizing fertility (reproductive endocrinologist). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;To prepare for your appointment: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask if there&apos;s anything you need to do in advance&lt;/strong&gt; to prepare for any possible tests.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of any symptoms you&apos;ve had&lt;/strong&gt; and for how long.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of your key medical information,&lt;/strong&gt; including any other conditions for which you&apos;re being treated and the names of any medications, vitamins, herbs or supplements you&apos;re taking.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a family member or friend along,&lt;/strong&gt; if possible, to help you remember everything.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of questions to ask&lt;/strong&gt; your doctor to help you make the most of your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some basic questions to ask your doctor include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the most likely cause of my signs and symptoms?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are there any other possible causes?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What treatment approach do you recommend, if any?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Am I a candidate for surgical treatment? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Am I at increased risk of problems during pregnancy?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What options are available to improve my chances of a successful pregnancy, if necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should I see a specialist?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are there any brochures or other printed materials that I can have? What websites do you recommend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&apos;t hesitate to ask questions any time that you don&apos;t understand something. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What to expect from your doctor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are your signs and symptoms, and when did you first notice them?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are your signs and symptoms continuous, or do they come and go?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you menstruate regularly?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is a typical menstrual period like for you?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have you ever been pregnant?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have been pregnant, what was the outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you hope to have biological children in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you currently being treated or have you recently been treated for any other medical conditions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				Tests and diagnosis
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
A double uterus may be diagnosed during a routine pelvic exam when your doctor observes a double cervix or feels an abnormally shaped uterus. If your doctor suspects an abnormality, he or she may recommend any of the following tests:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound.&lt;/strong&gt; This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. To capture the images, a device called a transducer is either pressed against your abdominal skin or inserted into your vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). Both types of ultrasound may be done to get the best view. A 3-D ultrasound may be used where available.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonohysterogram.&lt;/strong&gt; The sonohysterogram (son-o-HIS-ter-o-gram), an ultrasound scan, is done after fluid is injected through a tube into your uterus by way of your vagina and cervix. This allows your doctor to look for problems in the shape of your uterus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/strong&gt; The MRI machine looks like a tunnel that has both ends open. You lie down on a movable table that slides into the opening of the tunnel. This painless procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your body.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hysterosalpingography.&lt;/strong&gt; During a hysterosalpingography (his-tur-o-sal-ping-GOG-ruh-fe), a special dye is injected into your uterus through your cervix. As the dye moves through your reproductive organs, X-rays are taken to determine the shape and size of your uterus and whether your fallopian tubes are open. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
If you have a double uterus but you don&apos;t have signs or symptoms, treatment is rarely needed. Surgery to unite a double uterus is rarely done &amp;mdash; although surgery may help you sustain a pregnancy if you have a partial division within your uterus and no other medical explanation for a previous pregnancy loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&apos;re pregnant and have a double uterus, your risk of pregnancy complications may be higher due to the smaller size of your uterine cavity. This factor may lead to early delivery, often by C-section. Share any concerns you may have about childbirth with your doctor because he or she may suggest ways to help prevent preterm delivery or manage labor.
