				&lt;p&gt;
Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare lung condition in which the small airways (bronchioles), the tiny air-exchange sacs (alveoli) and the walls of small bronchi become inflamed and plugged with connective tissue. BOOP can have many causes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some people, BOOP causes no signs or symptoms. Most people who have BOOP experience a persistent nonproductive cough and &amp;mdash; depending on how much of the lung is affected &amp;mdash; shortness of breath with exertion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some forms of BOOP have identifiable causes, such as: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infections.&lt;/strong&gt; BOOP sometimes occurs after people have had certain infections, including chlamydia, influenza or malaria.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory disorders.&lt;/strong&gt; The risk of BOOP appears to be heightened for people who have disorders such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; People who have received certain types of chemotherapy or radiation to their chests sometimes develop BOOP.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transplanted tissue.&lt;/strong&gt; Bone marrow, lung, kidney and stem cell transplants sometimes trigger bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs that have been linked to BOOP include cocaine, gold salts, and some antibiotics and anti-seizure medications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some think that gastroesophageal reflux disease can be a provoking factor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your doctor is unable to identify a cause, the disorder is called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most people recover after weeks or months of treatment with a steroid such as prednisone, or treatment of the underlying infection if that&apos;s the cause. But in some people, BOOP can progress in spite of treatment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
