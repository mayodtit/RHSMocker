Unlike traditional hip replacement, hip resurfacing doesn&apos;t replace the &quot;ball&quot; of the hip with a metal or ceramic ball. Instead, the damaged hip ball is reshaped and capped with a metal prosthesis. The damaged hip socket also is fitted with a metal prosthesis &amp;mdash; similar to what is used in a conventional hip replacement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With newer materials, the artificial joint implants used for total hip replacement are lasting longer and may last for decades, although long-term data aren&apos;t yet available for newer implants. This isn&apos;t an issue for older people who receive a hip replacement late in life. But hip resurfacing might be a better choice for younger people because the procedure leaves more bone intact, which can make it easier to perform a total hip replacement if needed later. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Resurfacing generally results in a bigger hip ball than what is typically used in a conventional hip replacement, which may reduce the risk of dislocation. But newer implants used for conventional hip replacement now offer the option of a larger hip ball, similar in size to what results from hip resurfacing procedures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hip resurfacing is technically more difficult and generally requires a larger incision than what is used for a conventional hip replacement. And the risk of complications is slightly higher with hip resurfacing &amp;mdash; even when controlling for factors such as your age, sex and activity levels. Hip resurfacing results in a metal ball on a metal socket, and in a small number of people, these metallic moving parts may cause pain, immune system reaction (hypersensitivity) or, rarely, tissue destruction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hip resurfacing isn&apos;t recommended for people who have:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Impaired kidney function&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Known metal hypersensitivities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Large areas of dead bone (avascular necrosis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
