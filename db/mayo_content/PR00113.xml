As your pregnancy progresses, your baby might begin to seem more real. You might hear the heartbeat at your prenatal appointments, and your enlarging abdomen might force you to put away your favorite jeans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While you&apos;re adjusting to the changes in your body, fetal development takes on new meaning. Two months ago, your baby was simply a cluster of cells. Now he or she has functioning organs, nerves and muscles. Find out what happens during the second trimester by checking out this weekly calendar of events. Keep in mind that measurements are approximate.

				Week 13: Urine forms
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Thirteen weeks into your pregnancy, or 11 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s intestines have returned to his or her abdomen from the umbilical cord &amp;mdash; where they&apos;ve been growing for the past couple of weeks. Your baby is also beginning to form urine and discharge it into the amniotic fluid. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tissue that will become bone is also developing around your baby&apos;s head and within his or her arms and legs.

				Week 14: Baby&apos;s sex becomes apparent
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Fourteen weeks into your pregnancy, or 12 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s arms have almost reached the final relative lengths they&apos;ll be at birth and your baby&apos;s neck has become more defined. Red blood cells are forming in your baby&apos;s spleen. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your baby&apos;s sex will become apparent this week or in the coming weeks. For girls, ovarian follicles begin forming. For boys, the prostate appears. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By now your baby might be almost 3 1/2 inches (90 millimeters) long from crown to rump and weigh about 1 1/2 ounces (40 grams).

				Week 19: Baby&apos;s uterus forms
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Nineteen weeks into your pregnancy, or 17 weeks after conception, a greasy, cheese-like coating called vernix caseosa begins to cover your baby. The vernix caseosa helps protect your baby&apos;s delicate skin from abrasions, chapping and hardening that can result from exposure to amniotic fluid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For girls, the uterus and vagina might begin to form this week.

Twenty-two weeks into your pregnancy, or 20 weeks after conception, your baby is completely covered with a fine, down-like hair called lanugo. The lanugo helps hold the vernix caseosa on the skin. Your baby&apos;s eyebrows might be visible.

Twenty-three weeks into your pregnancy, or 21 weeks after conception, your baby&apos;s skin is wrinkled, more translucent than before and pink to red in color. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This week your baby begins to have rapid eye movements. Your baby&apos;s tongue will soon develop taste buds. Fingerprints and footprints are forming. For boys, the testes are descending from the abdomen. For girls, the uterus and ovaries are in place &amp;mdash; complete with a lifetime supply of eggs.
