Treatment of high cholesterol in children is controversial. Many doctors think that diet and exercise are the best initial treatment for children age 2 and older who have high cholesterol or who are obese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treating high cholesterol in children with prescription drugs, such as statins, for children age 8 and older if a child has a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or &quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol. This is because some researchers think that heart disease in adulthood can begin to develop early in a child&apos;s life if his or her cholesterol level is too high.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, many doctors disagree that cholesterol-lowering drugs are an appropriate treatment, since little research has been done on the safety and effectiveness of these drugs in children. Some doctors also think few children have a cholesterol level high enough to require cholesterol-lowering drugs as treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The long-term effects of using cholesterol-lowering drugs to treat high cholesterol in children haven&apos;t been studied much. In addition, certain cholesterol medications, such as niacin, aren&apos;t recommended for children because of safety concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because of disagreement in the medical community about treating high cholesterol in children, talk to your child&apos;s doctor about what&apos;s best for your child, including exercise and heart-healthy diet options.
