Is stress making you frustrated and irritable? Stress relievers can help restore calm and serenity to your chaotic life. You don&apos;t have to invest a lot of time or thought into stress relievers. If your stress is getting out of control and you need quick relief, try one of these tips. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Get active
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Virtually any form of physical activity can act as a stress reliever. Even if you&apos;re not an athlete or you&apos;re out of shape, exercise is still a good stress reliever. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Physical activity pumps up your feel-good endorphins and other natural neural chemicals that enhance your sense of well-being. Exercise also refocuses your mind on your body&apos;s movements, improving your mood and helping the day&apos;s irritations fade away. Consider walking, jogging, gardening, housecleaning, biking, swimming, weightlifting or anything else that gets you active. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Laugh more
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
A good sense of humor can&apos;t cure all ailments, but it can help you feel better, even if you have to force a fake laugh through your grumpiness. When you laugh, it not only lightens your mental load but also causes positive physical changes in your body. Laughter fires up and then cools down your stress response. So read some jokes, tell some jokes, watch a comedy or hang out with your funny friends. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Connect with others
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
When you&apos;re stressed and irritable, your instinct may be to wrap yourself in a cocoon. Instead, reach out to family and friends and make social connections. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Social contact is a good stress reliever because it offers distraction, provides support, and helps you tolerate life&apos;s up and downs. So take a coffee break with a friend, email a relative, or visit your place of worship. Got more time? Considering volunteering for a charitable group and help yourself while helping others. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Assert yourself
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
You might want to do it all, but you can&apos;t, at least not without paying a price. Learning to say no or being willing to delegate can help you manage your to-do list and your stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Saying yes may seem like an easy way to keep the peace, prevent conflicts and get the job done right. But it may actually cause you internal conflict because your needs and those of your family come second, which can lead to stress, anger, resentment and even the desire to exact revenge. And that&apos;s not a very calm and peaceful reaction. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Try yoga
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
With its series of postures and controlled-breathing exercises, yoga is a popular stress reliever. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve peacefulness of body and mind, helping you relax and manage stress and anxiety. Try yoga on your own or find a class &amp;mdash; you can find classes in most communities. Hatha yoga, in particular, is a good stress reliever because of its slower pace and easier movements.
&lt;/p&gt;

				Get enough sleep
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Stress often gives sleep the heave-ho. When you have too much to do &amp;mdash; and too much to think about &amp;mdash; your sleep suffers. But sleep is the time when your brain and body recharge. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the quality and amount of sleep you get affects your mood, energy level, concentration and overall functioning. If you have sleep troubles, make sure that you have a quiet, relaxing bedtime routine, listen to soothing music, put clocks away, and stick to a consistent schedule. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Keep a journal
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a good release for otherwise pent-up emotions. Don&apos;t think about what to write &amp;mdash; just let it happen. Write whatever comes to mind. No one else needs to read it, so don&apos;t strive for perfection in grammar or spelling. Just let your thoughts flow on paper &amp;mdash; or computer screen. Once you&apos;re done, you can toss out what you wrote or save it to reflect on later. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Get musical and be creative
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Listening to or playing music is a good stress reliever because it provides a mental distraction, reduces muscle tension and decreases stress hormones. Crank up the volume and let your mind be absorbed by the music. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If music isn&apos;t your thing, turn your attention to another hobby you enjoy, such as gardening, sewing, sketching &amp;mdash; anything that requires you to focus on what you&apos;re doing rather than what you think you should be doing. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Seek counseling
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
If new stressors are challenging your ability to cope or if self-care measures just aren&apos;t relieving your stress, you may need to look for reinforcements in the form of therapy or counseling. Therapy also may be a good idea if you feel overwhelmed or trapped, if you worry excessively, or if you have trouble carrying out daily routines or meeting responsibilities at work, home or school. Professional counselors or therapists can help you identify sources of your stress and learn new coping tools.
