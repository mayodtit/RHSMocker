				&lt;p&gt;
Cervical cysts &amp;mdash; mucus-filled lumps that form on the cervix &amp;mdash; are rarely cancerous. These cysts form when normal tissue on the outer part of the cervix (squamous epithelium) grows over the glandular, mucus-producing tissue of the inner part of the cervix (endocervical canal), trapping mucus and forming cysts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cervical cysts often are discovered incidentally during a pelvic exam. They generally don&apos;t cause symptoms and require no treatment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a cervical cyst looks unusual to your doctor, or you also have signs and symptoms that suggest cervical cancer &amp;mdash; for instance, abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse &amp;mdash; your doctor may perform a biopsy of your cervix. 
&lt;/p&gt;
