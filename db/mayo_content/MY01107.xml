				&lt;p&gt;
Chiropractic adjustment is a procedure in which trained specialists (chiropractors) use their hands or a small instrument to apply a controlled, sudden force to a spinal joint. The goal of chiropractic adjustment, also known as spinal manipulation, is to correct structural alignment and improve your body&apos;s physical function. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				Why it&apos;s done
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Low back pain, neck pain and headache are the most common problems for which people seek chiropractic adjustment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Chiropractic care is an outgrowth of belief in these concepts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your body has a natural ability to heal itself.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your body&apos;s structure &amp;mdash; nerves, bones, joints and muscles &amp;mdash; and capacity for healthy function are closely intertwined.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic treatment helps balance your body&apos;s structure and function and promotes self-healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				Risks
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Chiropractic adjustment is safe when it&apos;s performed by someone trained and licensed to deliver chiropractic care. Serious complications associated with chiropractic adjustment are overall rare, but may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A herniated disk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compression of nerves in the lower spinal column (cauda equina syndrome), which can cause pain, weakness, loss of feeling in your legs, and loss of bowel or bladder control&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A certain type of stroke (vertebral artery dissection) after neck manipulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&apos;t seek chiropractic adjustment if you have:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Severe osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Numbness, tingling or loss of strength in an arm or leg&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cancer in your spine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An increased risk of stroke&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An unstable spine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				How you prepare
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
No special preparation is required before a chiropractic adjustment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Chiropractic treatment may require a series of visits to your chiropractor. Ask your care provider about the frequency of visits and be prepared to work them into your schedule. It might be a good idea to bring your calendar along or have an idea of when in your schedule you can fit in visits to the chiropractic office. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many health insurance policies cover chiropractic care, but you might want to check to see how many treatments are covered in a given time period. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				What you can expect
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
At your initial visit, your chiropractor will ask questions about your health history and perform a physical exam, with particular attention to your spine. Your chiropractor may also recommend other examinations or tests, such as X-rays. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;During the adjustment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;During a typical chiropractic adjustment, your chiropractor places you in specific positions to treat affected areas. Often, you&apos;re positioned lying facedown on a specially designed, padded chiropractic table. The chiropractor uses his or her hands to apply a controlled, sudden force to a joint, pushing it beyond its normal range of motion. You may hear popping or cracking sounds as your chiropractor moves your joints during the treatment session. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional therapies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Your chiropractor may recommend other treatment approaches in combination with chiropractic adjustment, such as: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heat or ice&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Massage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stretching&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electrical stimulation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;After the adjustment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Some people experience minor side effects for a few days after chiropractic adjustment. These may include headache, fatigue or pain in the parts of the body that were treated.

				Results
			</SectionHead>
			<HTML>
				&lt;p&gt;
Chiropractic adjustment can be effective in treating low back pain, although much of the research done shows only a modest benefit &amp;mdash; similar to the results of more conventional treatments. Some studies suggest that spinal manipulation also may be effective for headaches and other spine-related conditions, such as neck pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not everyone responds to chiropractic adjustments. A lot depends on your particular situation. If your symptoms don&apos;t begin to improve after several weeks of treatments, chiropractic adjustment might not be the best option for you.
