Tailbone pain &amp;mdash; pain that occurs in or around the bony structure at the bottom of the spine (coccyx) &amp;mdash; can be caused by trauma to the coccyx during a fall, prolonged sitting on a hard or narrow surface, degenerative joint changes, or vaginal childbirth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tailbone pain can feel dull and achy but typically becomes sharp during certain activities, such as sitting, rising from a seated to a standing position or prolonged standing. Defecation and sex also might become painful. For women, tailbone pain can make menstruation uncomfortable as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tailbone pain, also called coccydynia or coccygodynia, usually goes away on its own within a few weeks or months. To lessen tailbone pain in the meantime, it might help to: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sit completely upright with proper posture &amp;mdash; keeping your back firmly against the chair, knees level with your hips, feet flat on the floor and shoulders relaxed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lean forward while sitting down&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sit on a doughnut-shaped pillow or wedge (V-shaped) cushion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply heat or ice to the affected area&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or aspirin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your tailbone pain doesn&apos;t improve (chronic coccydynia), consult your doctor. He or she might do a rectal exam to rule out any other conditions. Depending on the circumstances, he or she might refer you to a specialist in anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or orthopedic surgery. Your doctor or the specialist might recommend using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find out if you have a fracture, degenerative changes or, in rare cases, a tumor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Possible treatments for chronic tailbone pain might include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical therapy.&lt;/strong&gt; A physical therapist might show you how to do pelvic floor relaxation techniques, such as breathing deeply and completely relaxing your pelvic floor &amp;mdash; as you would while urinating or defecating. He or she might also show you exercises to strengthen your abdomen and pelvic floor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulation.&lt;/strong&gt; Massaging the muscles attached to the tailbone might help ease pain. Manipulation is typically done through the rectum.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medication.&lt;/strong&gt; An injection of a local anesthetic into the tailbone can relieve pain for a few weeks. Certain antidepressants or anti-epileptic medications might relieve tailbone pain as well.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery.&lt;/strong&gt; During a procedure known as a coccygectomy, the coccyx is surgically removed. This option is typically only recommended when all other treatments fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
