  # Interestingly enough, Rails uses the attr_accessible list in order to build
  # the params hash for the resource key when one is not specified.  As a result
  # in order to make the following keys appear in the resource params, we need
  # to put them in the attr_accessible list.  In the future, enforce that the
  # client must specify the resource key (I think).
  # TODO - remove this after sync up with client
